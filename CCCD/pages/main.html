Code clones are multiple code fragments that produce similar results when provided the same input. Prior work has shown that clones can be harmful since they elevate maintenance costs, increase the number of bugs caused by inconsistent changes to cloned code and may decrease programmer comprehensibility due to the increased size of the code base.  
<br /><br />
To assist in the detection of code clones, a number of tools have been proposed. Some of which include CCFinder, MeCC, CloneDR and Clonetracker. The majority of these tools depend on the syntactic similarities of code clones. However, a large number of code clones (e.g., Type-3 and Type-4 clones) contain a significant amount of syntactic differences. In this work we propose a new tool, called Concolic Code Clone Detection (CCCD), which uses concolic analysis to detect code clones. The advantage of this approach is that it discovers clones based on the functional not syntactic nature of the software. This means that numerous semantic issues which have plagued previous clone detection techniques do not have any adverse affects on CCCD. Based on our preliminary findings, CCCD has been highly effective in detecting clones of all types.
