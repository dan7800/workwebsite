<h1>MPerm: Android Permissions Analysis Tool</h1>

<h3>Project Abstract</h3>
	<p>Android Applications (apps) operate under a permissions-based system where access to APIs are restricted through the use of permissions. Unfortunately, there is no built-in verification system to ensure that apps do request too many, or too few permissions, which could lead to serious quality and privacy concerns. Apps which request too many permissions create unnecessary vulnerabilities, which may be abused by SDKs within the app or to other malicious apps installed on the device.</p>

<p>
With the introduction of Marshmallow 6.0 (M), the Android permission structure changed from requiring users to accept or reject all permissions at install time, to allowing developers to request permissions at run-time. Users will also have more control over altering the permissions the apps have been granted after the app has already been installed on their device. Some of the motivating factors for switching to this new model include streamlining the app installation and update process, and putting users more in control of the permissions their apps use.</p>

<p>
In order to assist with discovery of over and under privileges in Android apps in this new permission structure, we created a new detection tool, MPerm, which can quickly and easy identify permission misuse in Android apps. The tool, complete usage instruc- tions, screencast available via Youtube.
