<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Mobile computing has become an important part of our everyday lives, and the Android operating system has grown to be the most popular mobile platform. Unfortunately, Android applications (apps) are not immune to bugs, security vulnerabilities, and a wide range of other issues, a common theme in all software. Concolic analysis, a hybrid software verification technique which performs symbolic execution along a concrete execution path, has been used for a variety of purposes including software testing, code clone detection, and security-related activities.

We created a new publicly available concolic analysis tool for analyzing Android apps: Concolic Analysis for Android (CAA). Building on Java Path Finder (JPF), this tool performs concolic analysis on a raw Android application file (or source code) and provides output in a useful and easy to understand format. Included in this project are an introduction to the root concepts, a description of the tech stack used within the tool, and basic usage instructions.
