<h1>Student Advice</h1>



<p>I am regularly asked for advise by SE and computing students. Here are some recommendations for students.</p>


<ul>
	<li><b>Be a good problem solver.</b> Coding is obviously an imperative component to being a good software engineer/developer. However, while languages change between projects and over time, being a good problem solver is a skill which transcends projects, technologies and time itself.</li>
	<li><b>Never stop learning.</b> Computing is an ever changing field. If you are not progressing your skills, you are invariably falling behind. Focus on learning something new everyday. This could range from a language, to a design pattern, to a new type of testing. </li>
	<li><b>Focus on something you enjoy.</b> Computing is a big and diverse space. Find any area you enjoy and excel in that area. This could be in usability, testing, design, requirements elicitation, or any of the multitude of other areas. Be passionate about what you do.</li>
	<li><b>No replacement for hard work.</b> Success has no shortcuts. While you may temporarily succeed while not putting in the proper amount of effort, eventually things will catch up to you. This is true for all aspects of your academic and professional careers.</li>
	<li><b>Don't worry if you are not a superstar coder.</b> A common concern among students is that they are not a phenomenal coder. While coding is a big part of software development, don't let this scare you too much. There are many areas you can focus on, so be good in that area. </li>

	<li><b>Manage your career.</b> While you have numerous support services available to you, you are responsible for your own academic and professional career. </li>
