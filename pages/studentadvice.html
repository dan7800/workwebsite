<h1>Student Advice</h1>



<p>I am regularly asked for advice by SE and computing students. Here are some recommendations for students.</p>


<ul>
	<li><b>Be a good problem solver.</b> Coding is obviously an imperative component to being a good software engineer/developer. However, while languages change between projects and over time, being a good problem solver is a skill which transcends projects, technologies and time itself.</li>
	<li><b>Never stop learning.</b> Computing is an ever changing field. If you are not progressing your skills, you are invariably falling behind. Focus on learning something new everyday. This could range from a language, to a design pattern, to a new type of testing. </li>
	<li><b>Focus on something you enjoy.</b> Computing is a big and diverse space. Find any area you enjoy and excel in that area. This could be in usability, testing, design, requirements elicitation, or any of the multitude of other areas. Be passionate about what you do.</li>
	<li><b>No replacement for hard work.</b> Success has no shortcuts. While you may temporarily succeed while not putting in the proper amount of effort, eventually things will catch up to you. This is true for all aspects of your academic and professional careers.</li>
	<li><b>Don't worry if you are not a superstar coder.</b> A common concern among students is that they are not a phenomenal coder. While coding is a big part of software development, don't let this scare you too much. There are many areas you can focus on, so be good in that area. </li>

	<!--
	<li><b>Manage your career.</b> While you have numerous support services available to you, you are responsible for your own academic and professional career. </li>

	<h3>Thoughts on Research</h3>
	<p>I regularly conduct research with undergraduate and graduate students. Some pieces of advice I regularly share with them are: </p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Worry about the problem before you start worrying about the solution.</b> The problem statement is 1/2 the battle in research and is likely one of the most difficult &amp; time consuming sentences you will ever write.</li>
		<li><b>Make sure the problem is a real problem.</b> Using previous work, how can you define that it is an actual issue? Has it been explicitly stated to be a problem? If so, why haven't others solved it? If you think you can easily solve a research problem, then this is a red flag. If it was so easy/straightforward and was a real problem, then it is likely that someone else would have done the work a long time ago.</li>
		<li><b>Has the work already been done?</b> If so, then you are probably wasting your time.</li>
		<li><b>Creating an app is not research.</b> Although implementing a solution to a problem through the creation of the app can have real value add to the community, generally the creation of an app is not research.</li>
		<li><b>Learning a new technology/tool is not 'research'.</b> As a student, learning a new tool or technology may be VERY helpful, it is not considered to be real 'research.'</li>
		<li><b>Focus on an area that interests you.</b> While you may need to research an area a bit before it sparks your attention, at the end of the day you will do a much better job if you like the area you're focusing on. </li>
		<li><b>Research isn't easy.</b> If anyone says that research is easy, then they are probably lying or they are doing it wrong. If research was easy, then everyone would be doing it &amp; the examined problem would have been solved long ago. Research is a long and winding road which will take difficult, unforeseen and very often frustrating paths.</li>
